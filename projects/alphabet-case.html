      <h4>Background and challenges</h4>
      <p>In 2017, Alphabet (BMW Group), company leader in B2B car leasing, approached us to design and develop their new website, together with a content management system (CMS) upgrade and migration, from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.
As Lead Technical Project Manager, I had the opportunity to scope and execute the project from planning to final delivery.</p>

<p>Alphabet includes an International team based in Munich and 15 markets worldwide. The challenges were to create a back-end system that would allow for high flexibility and customisation, while the front-end would reflect the brand‚Äôs guidelines and unity. We were also confronted with short timings and budget. As project manager it was my responsibility to keep track of the features requests and to clearly communicate to clients what was agreed or out of the original scope.</p>


      <h4 class="solution-title">Solution</h4>
      <p class="solution-copy">
In order to cope with the timings requirements, we opted for an agile process and an atomic design methodology. The objective was to design on a weekly basis modules that would be approved by the clients and directly sent to programming. One of the success factor was the daily calls with our main clients, communicating the progress and the coming deliverables with deadlines for approvals.</p> 
<p>We started the project by doing a thorough audit of the existing Alphabet countries‚Äô websites, in order to analyse what were the needs of the markets based on the components they were already using on their websites. During an early stakeholders workshops, we presented our findings and gathered the requirements from the 4 pilot markets for the future back-end platform.
After scoping and agreeing on the features, we started wireframing, designing and prototyping the new website, based on a modular approach.</p>
<p>In parallel to this project, together with the same team, we developed an e-commerce platform for light commercial vehicles (LCV). One of the technical challenge was that we had to build and deploy this platform before the development of the new website. So while the e-commerce showroom would live already on Drupal 8, we had to find a workaround to temporarily place the platform on the Drupal 7 website and migrate it when the Drupal 8 site would be ready, keeping a seamless experience for the users. It required to work backwards as we designed the showroom with what could be the future look and feel of the website in mind, instead of designing the website and applying the same style to the showroom. But it was a special request from the client that we had to accommodate. Another challenge was the integration of the data from several different markets and their third parties data supplier. As they all used a different system, we created a master CSV file that would merge all the different requirements from the markets. This file would host all the possible properties of a car, such as the brand, load volume, kilometres and duration of the rental, there was more than 200 possibilities. It requested a close collaboration between the UX team and the clients on one side to understand the requirements and between the UX and the tech teams, to define how to best proceed with the creation of the file.</p>
      
<p>Towards the beginning of the year 2017, upon my request, my time was split 50% as technical PM and 50% as junior UX designer. While working as UX designer, under the supervision of the lead UX, I created wireframes and prototypes, designed small-scale UI component and designed the new version of the article page for the new website. I found myself very excited and confident in my new role and I enjoyed every minutes I would spend sketching, designing and presenting my ideas. Having a certain technical understanding definitely helped me communicating with the developers and understanding the limits of the platform when designing.

 <p>As a result of this experience, I moved to the UX department and produced deliverables that would be later implemented by the team. I developed my project management skills, lead workshops with important stakeholders and gained technical knowledge.</p>
