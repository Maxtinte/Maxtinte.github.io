      <h4>Background and challenges</h4>
      <p>In 2017 while I was still working as technical project manager, I had the opportunity to lead and manage the development of the new Alphabet website with countries rollouts, based on a CMS migration system from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.

<br>Alphabet - BMW group - is the leader of B2B car leasing. Their team includes an international team based in Munich and 15 markets all over the world.
 Every markets having different needs based on their cultural differences and location, the back-end system needed to allow for high flexibility and customisation, while the front-end would reflect the brand‚Äôs guideline and unity.
  </p>

      <h4 class="solution-title">Solution</h4>
      <p class="solution-copy">
        We started the project by doing a thorough audit of the existing Alphabet countries‚Äô websites, in order to analyse what were the needs of the markets based on the components they were using on their websites.

<br>We then organised and lead workshops to gather the requirements for the new platform from 4 pilot markets. At this stage we were also already discussing requirements and scope for the back-end system.

<p class="p-margin">With the requirements and needs defined, we started wireframing, designing and prototyping with weekly check-in calls with the clients.
The key success factor in the project were the almost daily alignment with the clients in an agile environment.</p>

<p class="p-margin">As lead TPM, I was in charge of the overall development of the project. From scoping, project proposal, roadmap, ensuring quality of deliverables, internal and external communication and overall project‚Äôs profitability.
<br>Towards the beginning of the year 2017, upon my request, my time was split 50% as technical PM and 50% as UX designer apprentice. While working as UX designer, I worked on developing wireframes and prototypes, the analysis and recommendations for Drupal 8 modules based on countries specific needs and finally designed small-scale UI component.
