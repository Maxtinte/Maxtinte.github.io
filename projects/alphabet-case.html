      <h4>Background and challenges</h4>
      <p>In 2017, Alphabet (BMW Group), company leader in B2B car leasing, approached us to design and develop their new website, together with a content management system (CMS) upgrade and migration, from Drupal 7 to Drupal 8.
As Lead Technical Project Manager, I had the opportunity to scope and execute the project from planning to final delivery.</p>

<p>Alphabet includes an International team based in Munich and 15 markets worldwide. The challenges were to create a back-end system that would allow for high flexibility and customisation, while the front-end would reflect the brand‚Äôs guidelines and unity. We were also confronted with short timings and budget, as project manager it was my responsibility to keep track of the features requests and to clearly communicate to clients what was agreed or out of the original scope.</p>


      <h4 class="solution-title">Solution</h4>
      <p class="solution-copy">
        We started the project by doing a thorough audit of the existing Alphabet countries‚Äô websites, in order to analyse what were the needs of the markets based on the components they were using on their websites.</p>

<p>We then organised and lead workshops to gather the requirements for the new platform from 4 pilot markets. At this stage we were also already discussing requirements and scope for the back-end system.</p>

<p class="p-margin">With the requirements defined, we started wireframing, designing and prototyping with bi-daily check-in calls with the clients, in an agile environment.</p>

<p class="p-margin">As lead TPM, I was in charge of the overall development of the project. From scoping, project proposal, roadmap, ensuring quality of deliverables, internal and external communication and overall project‚Äôs profitability.</p>
<p>Towards the beginning of the year 2017, upon my request, my time was split 50% as technical PM and 50% as UX designer apprentice. While working as UX designer, I worked on developing wireframes and prototypes, the analysis and recommendations for Drupal 8 modules based on countries specific needs and finally designed small-scale UI component.
