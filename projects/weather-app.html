      <h4>Background and challenges</h4>
      <p>A marine weather forecast project undertaken during my UX schooling. For this project I went through the full UX project life-cycle until final screens design to create a ready to build application.</p>
      <p>After a competitive analysis I quickly realised that marine weather applications are very often overloaded with information and their UI is too complex. But instead of jumping into design and hitting the same walls as my competitors, I decided to start my project by talking to people and listen to their stories.</p>
        <p>I wanted to understand what information are important in marine forecast, how people generally use weather forecast applications and what features do they consider as being important.</p>

      <h4 class="solution-title">Solution</h4>
      <p class="solution-copy">
        For this project I decided to constantly bring my ideas in front of potential users for testing. I‚Äôve tested my wireframes and navigation, I've conducted tests with paper prototypes, later on I performed usability testings with interactive prototypes and lastly I tested my design by doing preference tests with users.</p>
        <p>This constant test / iteration loop helped me to get rid of unnecessary features, simplify the UI and move on with confidence throughout the project.</p>

      <p>During my early interviews with people, I noticed that in marine activities like surfing, forecast monitoring is key, but is also time consuming, thus busy people can‚Äôt allow too much time for monitoring the weather, even when living near a beach spot. In response to that finding, I developed a preference system where the user would define all the requirements for what she considers like a good weather day to practise her activity. The App would monitor the forecast for her up to 2 weeks in advance. Once the App would find a suitable surfing day, it would send notifications with reports and alerts in case the weather would change unexpectedly.</p>

<p>Another functionality that I developed after interviewing users was a map where the user could ‚Äúdraw‚Äù and measure her perfect route, in order to help her planning her day.</p>

<p>My main objective when working on this App was to create a useful product. An App that would really help people to better monitor the weather forecast, take informed decisions to prevent risky situations and eventually help them making the most of their water activity.</p>

<p>The main take away was the value of talking and listening to users as early and often as possible. Indeed, the greatest iterations happened after the user testings. At every stages, it was crucial for the project to collect users' opinion and feedback.</p>

<p>Below, a short video where I go through my prototype, an overview of the main screen and an overview of the preference test I performed:</p>
