          <h3>Origin story</h3>
            <p class="p1"> Born in a peaceful French town, I‚Äôve studied international business and project management with the idea to work abroad.<br>
            I graduated and spent a year in hectic Shanghai, worked in oneiric Amsterdam for two years, and relocated to Berlin in 2016.</p>

           <p>I became a multi-cap user experience designer, made of professional experiences, schooling program and delightful encounters.<br>
            Before standing in the UX side, I spent three years learning the machinery of web-development as technical project manager, working with multi-disciplinary teams and handling clients.<br>
            I‚Äôm also a self taught coder with little knowledge but a growing appetite for HTML5/CSS3 and a written down plan with a wax seal on it to learn Javascript in 2018. I've coded this website myself <i>("hum")</i>.</p>

          <p>Last year I took a break from the digital world and spent two months at an organic farm in the tiniest village of Sweden, to volunteer. I was a woofer. It was fantastic.</p>
            
            <p>When I was picking up <a class="spinach" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonia_tetragonioides "target="_blank">New Zealand spinach</a>, I realised that contributing to a good cause made me genuinely happy and I figured that I simply have to apply this mantra to my career.
              <br>Thus, I decided to focus on helping and working for NGOs, social businesses and design agencies that work in the field of the environment, climate and sustainability.</p>

            <p>I‚Äôm lucky enough to be currently working as UX researcher freelancer for IDH - The sustainable trade initiative, which works towards sustainability development in southern regions.<br>At IDH I do research about their users, usability testings and website optimisation.</p>
            <p>Early 2018, I've freelanced as UX designer for Opigno - a Learning Management System software, helping them with concepts and wireframes for their new platform. </p>
            <p>I'm always keen for a chat to discuss potential UX work, as freelance or permanent contract, wherever in the world you might be.</p>
