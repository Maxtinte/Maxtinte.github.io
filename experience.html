          <p> <h3>Origin story</h3>
            Born in a peaceful French town, I‚Äôve studied international business and project management with the idea to work abroad.‚Ä®<br>
            I graduated and spent a year in hectic Shanghai, worked in oneiric Amsterdam for two years, and relocated to (404 unbiased adjective missing) Berlin in 2016.<br><br>

‚Ä®I became a multi-cap user experience designer, made of professional experiences, schooling program and delightful encounters.
I have over 3 years experience in building websites and managing multi-disciplinary teams as technical project manager.<br>
I‚Äôm also a self taught coder with little knowledge but a growing appetite for HTML5/CSS3 and a written down plan with a wax seal on it to learn Javascript in 2018. I've coded this website myself <i>("Oh, that explains everything")</i>.<br><br>


Last year I took a break from the digital world and spent two months at an organic farm in the tiniest village of Sweden, to volunteer. I was a woofer.<br>
I remember it as one of the best experience I‚Äôve ever had.<br><br>

When I was picking up <a class="spinach" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tetragonia_tetragonioides "target="_blank">New Zealand spinach</a>, I realised that contributing to a good cause made me genuinely happy and I figured that I simply have to apply this mantra to my career.<br>‚Ä®Thus, I decided to focus on helping and working for NGOs,
social businesses and design agencies that work in the field of the environment, climate and sustainability.<br><br>

I‚Äôm lucky enough to be currently working as UX researcher freelancer for IDH - The sustainable trade initiative, which works towards sustainability development in southern regions.<br>At IDH I do research about their users, usability testings and website optimisation.<br>
