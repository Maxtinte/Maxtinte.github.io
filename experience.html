          <h3>Origin story</h3>
            <p> Born in a French town, I‚Äôve studied international business and project management with the idea to work abroad. I graduated and spent a year in hectic Shanghai, worked in oneiric Amsterdam for two years, and then moved to Berlin in 2016.</p>

            <p>I grew my interest in UX design during my work as a technical project manager. Delightful encounters with UX professionals on a variety of projects encouraged me to decide for a career switch. I took a full time UX/UI course at CareerFoundry and scored a couple of exciting freelance UX projects.</p>

            <p>Beside mastering UX discipline, I am interested in web-development and tirelessly learning to code. I have written this website myself. By now, I have a satisfactory understanding and growing appetite for HTML5/CSS3. Javascript is the next on my list of languages to pick up in 2018.</p>
            
           <p> Next to my work in the digital world, I take any opportunity to appreciate nature. Last year I took a short break to volunteer at an organic farm in the tiniest village of Sweden. For two months, I was a farmer. I was a woofer. It was fantastic.</p>
           <p> When I was picking up New Zealand spinach, I realized that contributing to a good cause made me genuinely happy. I figured that I have to apply this mantra to my career.</p>

<p>I prefer to focus on helping NGOs, social businesses, and design agencies that work in the field of sustainability. My latest work for IDH, the sustainable trade initiative, only strengthen my wish to do so.</p> 

<p>If you are interested in my skill set, reach out for a chat. I'm always keen to discuss potential UX work - as freelance, or permanent contract, wherever in the world you might be.</p>
